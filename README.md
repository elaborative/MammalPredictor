# MammalPredictor
Mammal Predictor Machine Learning Demo

This project was developed as part of an EDX online learning certificate program in Data Science. The accompanying files are intended for use of EDX staff and fellow learners in the program. The RMD file is an R Markdown format which produces the PDF file provided. The R file is the R script only which was used to generate the RMD report results.

After I started working on this project - the Pantheria data source at the ESA web site became unreachable, so I have localized the data and metadata files to this github. You will need the PanTHERIA_1-0_WR05_Aug2008.txt data source to be located in the same directory as the Rmd file compile & run the project. The metadata file has been provided for reference only.
